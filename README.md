# TorchBits: A Lightweight Deep Signal Processing Library for Audio and Image Analysis

**TorchBits** is a minimalist, high-performance library designed for efficient deep signal processing in audio and image analysis tasks. Developed with both simplicity and scalability in mind, TorchBits leverages low-level optimizations in C++ and Python to bring fast, reliable processing to resource-constrained environmentsâ€”ideal for applications running on limited hardware such as Intel Pentium processors with 2GB RAM.

## Key Features
- **Matrix Operations**: Fast and optimized matrix multiplication using custom C++ and Python bindings for large-scale data processing.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Basic implementations inspired by ResNet and other popular architectures for denoising, classification, and feature extraction in images.
- **Signal Processing Tools**: Fundamental operations and utilities for spatial and frequency domain analysis, suited for both real-time and batch processing.
- **GPU Support**: Optional integration with CuPy for accelerated computations on compatible GPUs.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Designed for low memory usage, making it ideal for edge devices and low-spec systems.

## Installation
TorchBits can be easily installed via PyPI:
```bash
pip install torchbits
```
```python
from torchbits.image.net import Linear
from torchbits.image.loss import MSELoss

# Initialize a model
model = Linear(in_features=128, out_features=64)

# Forward pass
inputs = np.random.rand(32, 128).astype(np.float32)
predictions = model.forward(inputs)

# Calculate loss
loss = MSELoss()
target = np.random.rand(32, 64).astype(np.float32)
print("Loss:", loss(predictions, target))

```
